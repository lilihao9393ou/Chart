Web performance data chart
==========================

* Create an interface that allows you to enter a series of dates, each with a corresponding url and total
page response time in seconds. Any data previously entered should be displayed in a table.
* Display the data in some kind of graphical form (e.g. bar chart)
* The user should have the option to sort the data by any of the table columns. 
It should also be possible to amend and/or delete the data after it has been entered.
* allow the user to manipulate the graphic you produced in question two in some way and make the data they 
entered update automatically to reflect the change
